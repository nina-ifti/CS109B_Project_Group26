Science, based on scepticism, investigation and evidence, must continuously test its own concepts and claims. Faith, by definition, defies evidence: it is untested and unshakeable, and is therefore in direct contradiction with science.  In addition, though religions preach morality, peace and hope, in fact, says Dawkins, they bring intolerance, violence and destruction.
